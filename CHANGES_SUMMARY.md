# Summary of Changes - Processing Service Documentation

## Your Question
> "hold on. Where exactly is it grabbing its data from? How come when I read the code, I am seeing nothing that it is grabbing from the database itself."

## The Answer
**The Processing service does NOT directly access the MySQL database!** 

Instead, it follows a **microservices architecture** where:
1. **Processing service** makes HTTP GET requests to **Storage service**
2. **Storage service** queries the MySQL database
3. **Storage service** returns JSON data to **Processing service**
4. **Processing service** calculates statistics and saves to local `data.json` file

This is why you don't see any database queries in the Processing code - it uses HTTP REST API calls instead!

## What Was Changed

### 1. ✅ processing/app.py (Comprehensive Comments Added)
**What:** Added extensive inline documentation explaining the architecture

**Key additions:**
- Module-level docstring with ASCII architecture diagram
- Detailed comments for each function explaining what it does
- Step-by-step comments in `populate_stats()` function showing:
  - Step 1: Load or initialize statistics
  - Step 2: Prepare time window for queries
  - Step 3: Query temperature data from Storage service (via HTTP!)
  - Step 4: Query air quality data from Storage service (via HTTP!)
  - Step 5: Save updated statistics

**Example comment added:**
```python
# ============== STEP 3: Query Temperature Readings from Storage Service ==============
# Makes a GET request to: http://localhost:8090/temperature
# Parameters: start_timestamp and end_timestamp
# The Storage service will query MySQL for temperature records where:
#   date_created >= start_timestamp AND date_created < end_timestamp
# Example URL: http://localhost:8090/temperature?start_timestamp=2000-01-01T00:00:00Z&end_timestamp=2025-10-09T16:00:00Z
temp_response = requests.get(
    app_config['eventstores']['temperature']['url'],
    params={'start_timestamp': last_updated, 'end_timestamp': current_datetime}
)
```

### 2. ✅ processing/README.md (New File - 300+ lines)
**What:** Created comprehensive guide for the Processing service

**Sections include:**
- Overview and purpose
- Architecture diagram showing data flow
- How to run the service
- How to access (browser, Swagger UI, curl, PowerShell)
- API endpoints documentation
- Configuration explanation
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Testing the complete flow

**Visual diagram included:**
```

                     RAW EVENT DATA          STATISTICS ONLY
```

### 3. ✅ storage/app.py (Comments Added to GET Endpoints)
**What:** Added detailed comments to the functions that ACTUALLY query MySQL

**Key additions:**
- Docstrings for `get_temperature_readings()` and `get_airquality_readings()`
- Explanation that these are the functions Processing service calls via HTTP
- Example SQL queries that are executed
- Clear indication: "This is the ACTUAL database query"

**Example comment added:**
```python
def get_temperature_readings(start_timestamp, end_timestamp):
    """
    GET /temperature ENDPOINT - Retrieves temperature readings from MySQL database
    
    This endpoint is called by the Processing service to get temperature data.
    It directly queries the MySQL database and returns matching records as JSON.
    
    This queries MySQL:
        SELECT * FROM temperature 
        WHERE date_created >= '2025-10-09 15:00:00' 
        AND date_created < '2025-10-09 16:00:00'
    """
```

### 4. ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md (New File - 340+ lines)
**What:** Root-level comprehensive architecture documentation

**Sections include:**
- Overview answering "where does Processing get data?"
- Three services explained (Receiver, Storage, Processing)
- Step-by-step data flow (10 detailed steps)
- Why this architecture? (benefits of microservices)
- Common confusion points - answered with Q&A format
- How to test the complete flow
- Key files to examine with specific line references

**Key section:**
```
Q: "How come when I read the code, I am seeing nothing that it is grabbing from the database itself?"

A: Because Processing doesn't query the database! Look for HTTP requests instead:

# This is what you SHOULD look for in processing/app.py:
requests.get('http://localhost:8090/temperature', ...)

Not:
# This is what you WON'T find in processing/app.py:
session.execute(select(Temperature).where(...))  # This is in storage/app.py!
```

### 5. ✅ .gitignore (New File)
**What:** Added to prevent committing unnecessary files

**Excludes:**
- `__pycache__/` - Python compiled bytecode
- `*.log` - Log files
- `*.pyc` - Python cache files
- Other common temporary and build files

## How to Use This Documentation

### Quick Start - Read This First:
📖 **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Explains the complete data flow and answers your question

### When Working on Processing Service:
📖 **processing/README.md** - How to run, access, and troubleshoot the service
💻 **processing/app.py** - Read the inline comments to understand each function

### When Working on Storage Service:
💻 **storage/app.py** - Look at `get_temperature_readings()` and `get_airquality_readings()` to see actual MySQL queries

---

## Key Takeaways

### Before (Your Confusion):
❓ "Where is Processing grabbing data from?"
❓ "I don't see any database queries in Processing code"
❓ "Where is datastore and filename?"

### After (Now Clear):
✅ Processing queries **Storage service via HTTP** (not MySQL directly)
✅ Storage service contains the **actual MySQL queries**
✅ Two data stores: **MySQL** (raw events) and **data.json** (statistics)
✅ This is **microservices architecture** - services communicate via HTTP APIs

### What to Look For:

**In processing/app.py:**
```python
requests.get('http://localhost:8090/temperature', params={...})  ✅ HTTP request to Storage
```

**In storage/app.py:**
```python
session.execute(select(Temperature).where(...))  ✅ Actual MySQL query
```

## Troubleshooting Your Original Issue

### If Statistics Show Zeros:

**Issue:** `num_temp_readings` and `num_airquality_readings` are 0

**Causes & Solutions:**

1. **MySQL has no data**
   - Solution: POST data via Receiver service at http://localhost:8080/ui

2. **Timestamp issue** - `last_updated` in data.json is after your data
   - Solution: Delete `data.json` and restart Processing service
   ```bash
   cd processing
   rm data.json
   python app.py
   # Service will recreate with timestamp "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z" to catch all data
   ```

3. **Storage service not running**
   - Solution: Start Storage service first
   ```bash
   cd storage
   python app.py
   ```

4. **MySQL Docker not running**
   - Solution: Start Docker container
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Verification Steps:

1. **Check MySQL has data:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it microservice-db-1 mysql -u skibidi -phelpme fire_data \
     -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM temperature; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM airquality;"
   ```

2. **Check Storage service can query MySQL:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8090/temperature?start_timestamp=2000-01-01T00:00:00Z&end_timestamp=2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
   ```

3. **Check Processing service status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8100/stats
   ```

4. **Check Processing logs:**
   ```bash
   cd processing
   tail -f app.log
   # Should see: "Received X NEW temperature readings from MySQL (via Storage service)"
   ```

## Final Answer to Your Question

**Q: "Where exactly is it grabbing its data from?"**

**A:** The Processing service grabs data from the **Storage service HTTP API** at:
- `http://localhost:8090/temperature`
- `http://localhost:8090/airquality`

The Storage service then queries the **MySQL database** (running in Docker) and returns the results as JSON to the Processing service.

**Q: "How come when I read the code, I am seeing nothing that it is grabbing from the database itself?"**

**A:** Because it doesn't grab from the database directly! Look for this pattern in `processing/app.py`:
```python
temp_response = requests.get(
    app_config['eventstores']['temperature']['url'],  # http://localhost:8090/temperature
    params={'start_timestamp': last_updated, 'end_timestamp': current_datetime}
)
```

This is **HTTP REST API communication**, not direct database access. It's a microservices design pattern!
